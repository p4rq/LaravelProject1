This project covers fundamental PHP programming concepts using the Laravel 10 framework. It showcases essential components such as:

1. Model classes for database interaction.
2. Controller classes for handling user requests through defined routes.
3. Single-method controller classes dedicated to specific actions (like index, store, show, update, delete/soft delete, create).
4. Factories for managing data manipulation within the database.
5. Requests acting as validators for input types.
6. Services facilitating interactions between constructors' methods and model classes.
7. Policies regulating user access to specific data.
8. Components for seamless integration with external websites and hardcoded data access.
9. Imports for extracting data from Excel tables.
10. Resources for passing data from database tables, utilized by models, to controllers.
11. Filters for refining information using URLs.
12. Seeders for generating database information.
